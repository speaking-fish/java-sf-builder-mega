# Mega Builder

## Goals:
1. Builder avoid use in compile time (yes, context assist still works) of incorrect parameters combinations, and prevent incomplete configured objects to be built.
2. Create most complicated java builder pattern ever.

## Advantages:
1. No generation.
2. No annotations.
3. No dependences.

## Disadvantages:
1. Still use reflection and proxies, sorry.

##Usage
